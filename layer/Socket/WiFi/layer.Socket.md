WiFi IoT Socket
---------------
This implementation uses an IoT socket layer that connects to a 
[CMSIS-Driver WiFi](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Driver/html/index.html).

The file `socket_startup.c` configures the WiFi connection with these settings:
 - SSID:          network identifier
 - PASSWORD:      network password
 - SECURITY_TYPE: network security

Note: These settings need to be configured by the user!
